Easy 1

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.

CODE:

def len_of_lastword(string):
  words = string.split()
  if not words:
     return 0
  return  len(words[-1])

if __name__ == "__main__':
  string = "Hello World"
  result = len_of_lastword(string)
  print(result)

output:

For Example 1:
Input : "Hello World"
output : 5
The last word in the string is "World" which is of length 5. In the above code , split() method is used to split the string into words and then returning the len of the last word from the list.

For Example 2:
Input: "  fly me  to  the moon"
output: 4

For Example 3:
Input: "luffy is still joyboy"
output: 6
