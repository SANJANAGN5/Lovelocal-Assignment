Easy 1
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal 
substring consisting of non-space characters only.

CODE:

def len_of_lastword(string):
  words = string.split()
  if not words:
     return 0
  return  len(words[-1])

if __name__ == "__main__':
  string = "Hello World"
  result = len_of_lastword(string)
  print(result)

Explanation:
First line defines a function named 'len_of_lastword' that takes a parameter string.
split() method to split the input string into a list of words.which separates the words by whitespace characters.
'if' conditional statement is used to check if the list of word(words) is empty.
if the input string has no 'words'.Then the function returns 0,Because there is no lastword to determine the length.
'words[-1]' accesses  the last word in the string by its index [-1] and len() function is used to determine the last word's length.

Algorithm:
The algorithm used is straightforward with no complexity.
1.Splitting the String into words
2.Checking the empty string 
3.Finding the length of the last word in string by indexing.

Time Complexity of this algorithm is based on split() method which is O(n)Linear time complexity where 'n' is length of word.
list indexing and length calculation have constant time complexity.

OUTPUT:
For Example 1:
Input : "Hello World"
output : 5
The last word in the string is "World" which is of length 5. In the above code , split() method is used to split the string into words and then returning the len of the last word from the list.

For Example 2:
Input: "  fly me  to  the moon"
output: 4

For Example 3:
Input: "luffy is still joyboy"
output: 6
